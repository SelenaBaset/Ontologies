# Ontologies
Developed in the realm of the [NIE-INE](http://www.fee.unibas.ch/nie_ine.html) project.
For different scientific edition projects in the Humanities at the Basel University a series of extra- and interdependent vocabularies or ontologies are created, to express data and metadata in a formal machine-readable way. Formal here means adhering to the [model theory of W3C RDF, RDFS](https://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-mt-20020429/), and [OWL Full](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/).
The ontologies are declared in [Turtle syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/).
All the referenced ontologies are prefixed in a header.
