# Ontologies
Developed in the realm of the NIE-INE project.
For different scientific edition projects in the Humanities at the Basel University a series of interdependent and extradependent vocabularies are created, to express data and metadata in a formal machine-readable way.
They are declared in [Turtle syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/).
All the referenced ontologies are prefixed in a header.
